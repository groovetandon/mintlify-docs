## Create Your Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up">
    Go to [agents.decisional.com/sign-up](https://agents.decisional.com/sign-up) and create an account with your Google account or email.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Join or Create a Workspace">
    If you sign up with a company email, you'll automatically join your organization's workspace if one exists. Otherwise, a personal workspace is created for you.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Set Up Your Workspace

### Invite Your Team

Invite members from your organization directly into your workspace from the settings page. Workspace owners control who can view, edit, and manage agents.

### Connect Integrations

Your agents will ask you to connect apps as they need them, but you can also set them up ahead of time.

Go to **Integrations** in the sidebar, pick the app you want to connect, and follow the authorization flow. Common first integrations:

- **Slack** — for notifications and triggers
- **Gmail** — for sending and reading emails
- **HubSpot** — for CRM data
- **Google Sheets** — for spreadsheet access

<Tip>
  Integrations can be shared across your workspace or kept private to specific agents.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't sign in with Google">
    Make sure pop-ups are allowed for agents.decisional.com and third-party cookies are enabled. If it still doesn't work, try email and password signup instead.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Integration won't connect">
    Check that you have admin access to the service you're connecting and that pop-ups are enabled. Try a different browser or clear your cache if it's still not working.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't find my organization's workspace">
    Ask a teammate to send you an invitation, or make sure you're signing up with the same email domain as your team.
