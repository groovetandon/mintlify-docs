## What is Decisional?

Decisional is a **spreadsheet-native automation platform** that transforms your Excel or Google Sheets into autonomous AI agents. Unlike traditional no-code tools that force you into rigid workflow builders, Decisional lets you work the way you already do—with spreadsheets.

<Card title="Core Philosophy" icon="lightbulb">
  **We let Agents perform powerful automations for you within the comfort of a spreadsheet.** The spreadsheet acts as proof of work for your agent as well as a way to control its work. It's flexible, familiar, and captures your business logic in a format you already understand.
