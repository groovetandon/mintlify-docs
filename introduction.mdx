## What is Decisional?

Decisional helps you build agents for specific workflows, but 10x easier to setup and maintain. You just ask for an agent in natural language, it builds and tests its own workflow that it runs constantly, and you can manage it by just talking to it.

<Card title="Core Philosophy" icon="lightbulb">
  **Describe what you want automated, and your agent figures out the rest.** It builds its own workflow, connects to your tools, tests itself, and runs on autopilot. When something needs to change, just tell it.
</Card>

## Why Decisional?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Just Talk to It" icon="message">
    Describe what you want in plain English. Your agent builds its own workflow, no dragging blocks or writing code.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Works with Your Apps" icon="plug">
    Connects to Slack, HubSpot, Gmail, Google Sheets, and more. Your agent uses the tools you already use.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Runs End to End" icon="check">
    Unlike tools that get you 70% there, your agent completes the entire workflow from start to finish.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Understands Your Documents" icon="brain">
    Upload PDFs, contracts, spreadsheets. Your agent reads and reasons over them to get the job done.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe Your Agent">
    Tell Decisional what you want automated in plain English. Upload any relevant documents or spreadsheets for context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your Agent Builds Itself">
    Decisional generates a workflow, connects to your integrations, and tests everything automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and Approve">
    See exactly what your agent will do before it goes live. Approve actions, tweak instructions, or ask it to change things.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Let It Run">
    Your agent runs on autopilot with triggers, schedules, or on demand. Monitor progress and manage it through chat.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Makes Decisional Different

| | Traditional Automation | Decisional |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Setup** | Drag blocks, configure each step | Describe what you want in plain English |
| **Maintenance** | Rebuild when things break | Tell your agent what to change |
| **Flexibility** | Rigid, pre-defined actions | Agents reason through edge cases |
| **Documents** | Limited to API data | Reads and understands your files |
| **Completion** | Gets you partway there | Finishes the entire workflow |

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agents Build Their Own Workflows">
    You don't need to map out every step. Describe the outcome you want and your agent figures out how to get there, including which tools to use and what order to do things in.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Manages Itself Through Chat">
    Need to change something? Just tell your agent. No need to dig into settings or rebuild workflows. It updates itself based on your instructions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reads and Reasons Over Documents">
    Upload any document and your agent understands it. PDFs, contracts, spreadsheets, emails. It uses retrieval-augmented generation to pull the right context when it needs it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connects to the Apps You Use">
    Slack, HubSpot, Gmail, Google Sheets, and more. Your agent works with your existing tools so nothing changes about how your team operates.
