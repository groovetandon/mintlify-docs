## Overview

Decisional offers two ways to work with Slack:

1. **Slack Integration** — Connect your Slack account so agents can post messages, read channels, and interact with your workspace on your behalf
2. **Slack Connection** — Chat with your agents directly from Slack DMs instead of the Decisional app

These are independent features. You can use one, both, or neither depending on your needs.

## Slack Integration

The Slack integration lets your agents take actions in Slack — posting messages, reading channels, and more. This is useful for automations like posting daily reports, sending alerts, or responding to channel activity.

### Connecting Your Slack Account

1. Go to **Integrations** in the left sidebar
2. Find **Slack** in the list of available integrations
3. Click **Connect**
4. Select your Slack workspace and sign in if prompted
5. Review the permissions and click **Allow**
6. Name your connection (e.g., "Work Slack" or "Marketing Team")

Your connected account appears in your integrations list with an **Active** status.

<Tip>
  You can connect multiple Slack accounts or workspaces. Each connection is separate and can be used by different agents.
</Tip>

### Using Slack in Your Agents

After connecting, you can use Slack actions in your agents:

1. Open your agent in the builder
2. In the **Connections** section, find the Slack toolkit
3. Select which connected account to use
4. Reference Slack actions in your agent instructions

**Available actions include:**
- **Send Message** — Post a message to a channel or DM
- **Read Channel** — Get recent messages from a channel
- **Reply in Thread** — Respond to an existing message
- **List Channels** — Get channels the bot can access

### Example: Daily Summary Agent

```
Every day at 9am:
1. Pull sales data from the CRM
2. Summarize key metrics
3. Post the summary to #sales-updates using <slack-send-message>
```

### Sharing Connections

By default, your Slack connection is private. To let teammates use it:

1. Go to **Integrations**
2. Click on your Slack connection
3. Toggle **Share with workspace**

Shared connections appear under "Shared Credentials" when teammates configure their agents.

<Warning>
  Shared connections let others send messages as you. Only share with trusted teammates.
</Warning>

### Managing Connections

**To disconnect:**
1. Go to **Integrations**
2. Find your Slack connection
3. Click the menu (⋮) and select **Delete**

You can also revoke access from Slack's App Management settings.

## Slack Connection

Slack Connection lets you chat with your Decisional agents directly from Slack. Instead of switching to the Decisional app, just message the bot and your agent responds right in Slack.

### How It Works

1. **You message the Decisional bot** in Slack
2. **Your message syncs** to your Decisional workspace as a new thread
3. **Your agent processes** the message and generates a response
4. **The response appears** back in your Slack DM

Messages you send appear as coming from you (not the bot), so the conversation feels natural. While your agent is thinking, you'll see a "Thinking..." indicator.

### Setting Up Slack Connection

Slack Connection requires two steps: installing the bot (admin), then connecting your account (each user).

#### Step 1: Install the Slack Bot (Admin Only)

A workspace admin must first install the Decisional bot:

1. Go to **Settings** (click your profile in the top-right)
2. Scroll to the **Messaging Platforms** section
3. Find the **Slack Workspace** card
4. Click **Install Slack**
5. Select your Slack workspace
6. Review the permissions and click **Allow**

Once installed, the bot can DM any member of your Slack workspace.

<Warning>
  Only workspace admins can install the Slack bot. If you don't see the Install button, contact your admin.
</Warning>

#### Step 2: Connect Your Slack Account

After the bot is installed, each user connects their account:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Find the **Slack Slack Connection** card
3. Click **Connect Slack**
4. Sign in to Slack if prompted
5. Click **Allow** to authorize

Your Slack username appears once connected.

#### Step 3: Enable Slack Connection

Toggle on Slack Connection to start syncing messages:

1. In the **Slack Slack Connection** card, flip the toggle to enable
2. Open Slack and find **Decisional** in your DMs
3. Send a message — it will appear in your Decisional workspace

<Tip>
  You can toggle DM sync on and off anytime without disconnecting your account.
</Tip>

### Chatting with Agents

#### Starting a Conversation

1. Open Slack
2. Find **Decisional** in your Direct Messages (or search for it)
3. Type your message and send
4. Wait for the agent to respond

Your message creates a new thread in Decisional. The agent's response appears both in Decisional and back in Slack.

#### Continuing a Conversation

Reply in the same Slack DM thread to continue the conversation. Each Slack thread maps to a single Decisional thread, so context is preserved.

#### Interactive Messages

Some agent responses include interactive elements:

- **Action buttons** — Click to trigger agent actions
- **Question options** — Select answers to clarifying questions
- **Status indicators** — See the current state of workflows

Click buttons directly in Slack to interact with your agent.

### Managing Slack Connection

**To view status:** Go to **Settings** and check the Slack cards

**To disable sync:** Toggle off Slack Connection in Settings (keeps your account connected)

**To disconnect:** Click **Disconnect** in the Slack Slack Connection card

**To remove the bot (admin):** Click **Disconnect** in the Slack Workspace card

<Warning>
  Removing the workspace bot disconnects all users. Individual users can disconnect their own accounts without affecting others.
</Warning>

## Integration vs Slack Connection

| Feature | Slack Integration | Slack Slack Connection |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Purpose** | Agents take actions in Slack | You chat with agents via Slack |
| **Setup** | Connect via Integrations page | Install bot + connect in Settings |
| **Who uses it** | Your agents | You |
| **Example** | Agent posts report to #channel | You ask agent a question via DM |
| **Requires** | Composio OAuth | Bot installation + user connection |

**Use Integration when:** Your agents need to post messages, read channels, or automate Slack workflows

**Use Slack Connection when:** You want to chat with your agents from Slack instead of the Decisional app

## Troubleshooting

### Integration Issues

**Connection shows "Expired"**
- Go to Integrations and reconnect your Slack account
- Re-authorize the permissions

**Agent can't post to a channel**
- Ensure the Slack bot is added to the channel
- Check that the correct connection is selected in the agent

**Messages not sending**
- Verify the connection is Active in Integrations
- Check the run details for error messages

### Slack Connection Issues

**Bot not responding**
- Check Slack Connection is enabled in Settings
- Verify your agent is published and live
- Try the Decisional app — if it works there, the issue is Slack-specific

**Messages not syncing**
- Reconnect your account in Settings
- Ensure you authorized all requested permissions

**"Thinking..." never updates**
- Wait a moment for complex requests
- Check the Decisional app for the response
- Send a new message to create a fresh thread

## Privacy & Security

**For Integration:**
- OAuth tokens are encrypted at rest
- Only you (or teammates if shared) can use your connection
- Revoke access anytime from Integrations or Slack settings

**For Slack Connection:**
- The bot only accesses DMs with itself — not your other conversations
- Messages sync only to your Decisional workspace
- Tokens are encrypted at rest
- Disconnect anytime from Settings
