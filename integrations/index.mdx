## Connecting an Integration

1. Open your agent or go to **Workspace Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Find the integration you want
3. Click **Connect**
4. Authorize access (OAuth) or enter credentials (API key)
5. Name your connection for easy reference

## Managing Connections

### Viewing Connections

Go to **Workspace Settings** > **Integrations** to see:

- All connected integrations
- Connection status (active, expired, error)
- Which agents use each connection

### Reconnecting

If a connection expires or has issues:

1. Click on the connection
2. Click **Reconnect**
3. Re-authorize with the service

### Sharing Connections

By default, connections are private. To share with your workspace:

1. Click on the connection
2. Toggle **Share with workspace**
3. All workspace members can now use this connection

## Integration Security

- OAuth tokens are encrypted at rest
- Tokens are never exposed in logs or UI
- You can revoke access from Decisional or the service
- Minimal permissions requested (only what's needed)

## Rate Limits

Integrations have rate limits set by the external service:

| Service | Typical Limit |
|---------|---------------|
| Slack | 1 message/second |
| HubSpot | 100 requests/10 seconds |
| Google Sheets | 100 requests/minute |

Agents automatically handle rate limits with retries and backoff.

<Warning>
  Heavy automation may hit rate limits. Contact the service provider to increase limits if needed.
