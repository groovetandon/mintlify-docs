<Update label="February 6, 2026" tags={["New features", "Improvements"]}>
  ## Skills

  Upload markdown files to give your agents specialized knowledge, instructions, or playbooks. Agents reference these skills during builds and conversations.

  - Upload, view, and delete `.md` skill files per agent
  - Toggle between **Preview** (rendered markdown) and **Raw** (source text) views

  ## Platform Tools for Workflows

  Two new built-in tools available inside workflow node code:

  | Tool | Description |
  |------|-------------|
  | `call_ai_tool(prompt)` | Run AI-powered processing within any workflow step |
  | `query_knowledge_base(query)` | Search your agent's knowledge base from workflow code |

  ## File Uploads in Chat

  You can now upload files directly to your agent during conversations for processing.

  ## Redesigned Home Page

  Clean, centered layout with a collapsible sidebar for a more focused experience.

  ## Chat-Driven Build & Test

  Building and testing agents now happens through natural chat messages instead of separate buttons — making the entire agent creation feel like a conversation.

  ## Pre-Execution Approval

  Action nodes in test runs now pause **before** executing, giving you full control to approve or reject each action.

  ## Improved Sandbox Reliability

  Agents automatically recover from inactive sandbox states, so conversations always work — even after extended breaks.

  ### Other Improvements

  - **Browser notifications** when agent builds complete
  - **Higher character limits** in the prompt input box
  - **Better thought labels** — clearer display of what your agent is doing (e.g., "Searching Web", "Fetching Page")
  - **Sandbox setup loader** — animated UI while your agent's environment initializes

  ## Slash Commands in AI Assistant

  You can now use **slash commands** in the AI Assistant chat to quickly execute agent actions without clicking buttons.

  ### Available Commands

  | Command | Description |
  |---------|-------------|
  | `/connect` | Open the integrations panel to connect tools |
  | `/build` | Build the agent workflow |
  | `/test` | Test the agent |
  | `/edit` | Return agent to draft mode for editing |
  | `/retest` | Re-run tests after making changes |
  | `/publish` | Publish the agent to live |

  ### How to Use

  1. Type `/` in the chat input to see available commands
  2. Use arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select
  3. Type to filter commands (e.g., `/con` shows only `/connect`)
  4. Press Escape to dismiss

  Commands are **context-aware**—only actions valid for your agent's current status are enabled. For example, `/publish` is only available after testing.

  ### Other Improvements

  - **Better text wrapping**: Long URLs and text now wrap properly in chat messages
  - **Subtle scrollbars**: Cleaner, more minimal scrollbar styling throughout the app
