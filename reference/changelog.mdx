  ## Slash Commands in AI Assistant

  You can now use **slash commands** in the AI Assistant chat to quickly execute agent actions without clicking buttons.

  ### Available Commands

  | Command | Description |
  |---------|-------------|
  | `/connect` | Open the integrations panel to connect tools |
  | `/build` | Build the agent workflow |
  | `/test` | Test the agent |
  | `/edit` | Return agent to draft mode for editing |
  | `/retest` | Re-run tests after making changes |
  | `/publish` | Publish the agent to live |

  ### How to Use

  1. Type `/` in the chat input to see available commands
  2. Use arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select
  3. Type to filter commands (e.g., `/con` shows only `/connect`)
  4. Press Escape to dismiss

  Commands are **context-aware**—only actions valid for your agent's current status are enabled. For example, `/publish` is only available after testing.

  ### Other Improvements

  - **Better text wrapping**: Long URLs and text now wrap properly in chat messages
  - **Subtle scrollbars**: Cleaner, more minimal scrollbar styling throughout the app
