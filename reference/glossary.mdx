## Core Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent" icon="robot">
    An autonomous AI worker that executes your business workflows. Agents understand natural language instructions, process documents, and complete tasks automatically.

    **Example:** A Quote Generation Agent that creates customized quotes based on customer requirements.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Worksheet" icon="table">
    A full-featured spreadsheet where your agent reads input data and writes output. Worksheets are powered by SpreadJS and support all standard Excel features (formulas, charts, formatting, etc.).

    **Example:** A price list where your agent looks up product prices and writes generated quotes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sources" icon="folder">
    Documents, files, and links that provide context to your agents. Sources help agents make informed decisions by giving them access to company policies, examples, and reference materials.

    **Example:** Uploading past quote PDFs so your agent can match your formatting style.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Run" icon="play">
    A single execution of your agent's workflow. Each time your agent performs its task, that's a run. Runs have a status (Running, Completed, Failed, Needs Review) and include detailed logs.

    **Example:** When your Quote Generation Agent processes 10 customer requests, that's one run.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Workspace" icon="users">
    A container for your team's agents, worksheets, sources, and integrations. Workspaces can be personal (individual use) or organizational (team collaboration).

    **Example:** "Acme Corp Sales" workspace containing all quote generation and CRM automation agents.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Integration" icon="plug">
    A connection to an external service that your agent can interact with. Integrations enable agents to send emails, update CRMs, post to Slack, query databases, and more.

    **Example:** Gmail integration allowing your agent to send quotes via email.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Trigger" icon="clock">
    The mechanism that activates your agent. Triggers can be time-based (schedule), event-based (webhook, new data), manual (click Run button), or API-based (programmatic).

    **Example:** "Run every day at 9 AM" or "Run when a new row is added to the worksheet."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical Terms

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)" icon="brain">
    A technique where the AI retrieves relevant information from your documents before generating a response. This allows agents to reference specific pages, sections, and data points from your sources.

    **How it works:**
    1. Your documents are indexed when uploaded
    2. When the agent runs, it searches for relevant sections
    3. Retrieved content is used to inform the agent's decisions
    4. The agent cites specific sources and page numbers

    **Example:** Agent extracts pricing from "Q4 Price List.pdf" page 3, paragraph 2, and cites it in the quote.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bounding Box Citation" icon="square">
    The exact location within a PDF where information was found. Bounding boxes show the specific paragraph, table, or section the agent referenced, highlighted with a rectangular box.

    **Why it matters:** You can verify the agent didn't hallucinate by seeing exactly what it read.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OCR (Optical Character Recognition)" icon="image">
    Technology that extracts text from images and scanned PDFs. Decisional automatically applies OCR to scanned documents so agents can read them.

    **Best practices:**
    - Use 300 DPI or higher for scans
    - Ensure good contrast (black text on white background)
    - Avoid skewed or rotated pages
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SpreadJS" icon="table-cells">
    The professional-grade spreadsheet engine powering Decisional worksheets. SpreadJS provides full Excel compatibility including formulas, charts, conditional formatting, and more.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agentic Reasoning" icon="brain">
    The ability of AI agents to think through problems, handle edge cases, and adapt to new situations - not just follow rigid rules. Agentic reasoning allows Decisional agents to handle complex workflows that traditional automation can't.

    **Example:** If a product is out of stock, the agent suggests alternatives instead of failing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Semantic Search" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Search based on meaning, not just keywords. When your agent searches sources, it finds conceptually relevant information even if exact words don't match.

    **Example:** Searching for "price" will also find "cost", "fee", "rate", etc.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Workflow Terms

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Input Data" icon="right-to-bracket">
    The data your agent receives to process. This typically comes from worksheet rows, API calls, email triggers, or form submissions.

    **Example:** Customer name, product, and quantity from a "Quote Requests" spreadsheet.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Output Data" icon="right-from-bracket">
    The results your agent produces. This is written to worksheets, sent via integrations (email, Slack), or returned via API.

    **Example:** Generated quote with calculated prices, discounts, and total.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Instructions" icon="file-lines">
    Natural language description of what your agent should do. Instructions are written like you're training a new team member.

    **Example:**
    ```
    You are an Invoice Processing Agent.
    Extract key details from uploaded invoices and add them to the tracking spreadsheet.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Human-in-the-Loop" icon="user-check">
    A workflow pattern where the agent pauses for manual review before proceeding. Useful for high-stakes decisions.

    **Example:** "If quote exceeds $50,000, flag for manager approval before sending."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Batch Processing" icon="layer-group">
    Processing multiple items in a single run. Agents can process entire worksheets or lists of items efficiently.

    **Example:** Generate 100 quotes from 100 customer requests in one run.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error Handling" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    How your agent responds to problems. Good agents log errors, continue processing remaining items, and notify you of issues.

    **Example:** If one invoice fails to process, log it to an "Errors" sheet and continue with the rest.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Data & Storage Terms

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sheet" icon="file">
    A single tab within a worksheet (workbook). You can have multiple sheets for organizing data (e.g., "Requests", "Outputs", "Errors", "Reference Data").
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cell" icon="square">
    A single box in a spreadsheet, identified by column letter and row number (e.g., A1, B5, Z100).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Formula" icon="function">
    An Excel-style calculation (e.g., `=SUM(A1:A10)`, `=VLOOKUP(B2, Prices!A:B, 2, FALSE)`). Agents understand and respect formulas.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Named Range" icon="tag">
    A friendly name for a group of cells (e.g., "CustomerNames" for cells B2:B100). Makes formulas more readable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data Validation" icon="circle-check">
    Rules that constrain what can be entered in cells (e.g., dropdown lists, number ranges, date ranges). Helps ensure data quality.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conditional Formatting" icon="palette">
    Automatic cell formatting based on values (e.g., highlight cells red if value > 1000). Useful for visual alerts.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integration & API Terms

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Webhook" icon="webhook">
    A callback URL that triggers your agent when an external event occurs. Webhooks enable real-time automation.

    **Example:** When a form is submitted on your website, it sends a webhook to trigger your agent.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API (Application Programming Interface)" icon="code">
