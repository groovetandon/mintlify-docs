---

## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to install anything?" icon="download">
    **No!** Decisional is entirely cloud-based. Just go to [app.decisional.com](https://app.decisional.com) in your web browser and sign up. No downloads, no installations.

    **Recommended browsers:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge (latest versions)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does it take to create my first agent?" icon="clock">
    **About 5 minutes.** Our quickstart guide walks you through creating a Quote Generation Agent from start to finish. You'll:
    1. Upload a spreadsheet (30 seconds)
    2. Write instructions (2 minutes)
    3. Test your agent (2 minutes)

    Once you get the hang of it, you can create new agents in under 2 minutes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to know how to code?" icon="code">
    **No coding required!** You write instructions in plain English, like training a new employee.

    **Example:**
    ```
    You are a Quote Generation Agent.
    Look up prices from the price list and create quotes for customers.
    ```

    However, if you want to use our API for advanced integrations, some programming knowledge helps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use my existing spreadsheets?" icon="table">
    **Yes!** Upload your existing Excel (.xlsx, .xls) or CSV files. All your data, formulas, and formatting are preserved.

    You can also start with a blank spreadsheet and build from scratch.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to my data?" icon="shield">
    **Your data is secure and private:**
    - Stored in encrypted databases
    - Hosted on secure cloud infrastructure
    - Never shared with third parties
    - You own your data and can export it anytime

    Read our [Privacy Policy](https://www.decisional.com/privacy) for details.

## Agents & Workflows

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What can agents actually do?" icon="robot">
    Agents can handle a wide variety of business tasks:

    **Document Processing:**
    - Extract data from PDFs (invoices, contracts, forms)
    - Generate documents (quotes, reports, emails)
    - Classify and route documents

    **Data Operations:**
    - Update spreadsheets
    - Enrich data from external sources
    - Clean and validate data
    - Perform calculations

    **Integrations:**
    - Send emails (Gmail, Outlook)
    - Update CRMs (HubSpot, Salesforce)
    - Post to Slack/Teams
    - Query databases
    - Call APIs

    **Decision Making:**
    - Route items based on rules
    - Flag items for human review
    - Prioritize and categorize

    See [Workflow Tutorials](/workflows/finance/quote-generation) for specific examples.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How accurate are agents?" icon="bullseye">
    **Very accurate when properly configured.** Accuracy depends on:

    1. **Clear instructions**: Specific, detailed instructions → better results
    2. **Quality sources**: Clean, relevant documents → higher accuracy
    3. **Good data structure**: Well-organized worksheets → fewer errors

    **Tips for maximum accuracy:**
    - Test with real data before going live
    - Use data validation in worksheets
    - Add verification steps in your workflow
    - Review run logs regularly

    For mission-critical tasks, use human-in-the-loop patterns (agent flags items for review).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can agents handle exceptions and edge cases?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Yes!** Unlike traditional automation that breaks on edge cases, Decisional agents use **agentic reasoning** to adapt.

    **Example:**
    - **Traditional automation:** "If SKU not found, fail"
    - **Decisional agent:** "If SKU not found, search by product name, suggest alternatives, or flag for review"

    You guide this behavior in your instructions:
    ```
    If the vendor is not in the vendor list:
    1. Search for similar names
    2. Add them as a new vendor
    3. Send a notification to the admin
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many items can an agent process at once?" icon="layer-group">
    **Thousands of items in a single run.** Decisional is designed for batch processing.

    **Typical performance:**
    - Simple data updates: 1,000+ rows in 1-2 minutes
    - Document extraction: 100+ PDFs in 5-10 minutes
    - Complex workflows: Hundreds of items in under 10 minutes

    **Best practices for large volumes:**
    - Process in batches (e.g., 500 at a time)
    - Use efficient worksheet structures
    - Run during off-peak hours if time isn't critical
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I pause or stop a running agent?" icon="pause">
    **Yes!** While an agent is running, you can:
    - **Cancel**: Stop immediately (partial results may be saved)
    - **Pause**: Coming soon

    If you need to modify the agent, cancel the current run, make your changes, and start a new run.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Sources & Documents

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What file types can I upload as sources?" icon="file">
    **Documents:**
    - PDF (.pdf) - up to 50MB
    - Microsoft Word (.docx, .doc)
    - Microsoft Excel (.xlsx, .xls)
    - PowerPoint (.pptx)
    - Text files (.txt, .csv, .json, .xml, .md)

    - OCR automatically applied

    **Web:**
    - Any public URL
    - API endpoints (with authentication)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the agent understand my documents?" icon="brain">
    **Using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):**

    1. **Upload**: You upload a PDF (e.g., pricing policy)
    2. **Indexing**: Decisional extracts and indexes the text
    3. **Retrieval**: When your agent runs, it searches for relevant sections
    4. **Citation**: The agent references specific pages and paragraphs
    5. **Verification**: You can click citations to see the exact source

    **Bounding boxes** show you exactly what the agent read, highlighted in the PDF.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can agents read scanned documents?" icon="image">
    **Yes!** Decisional automatically applies OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to:
    - Scanned PDFs
    - Images of documents
    - Receipts
    - Forms

    **For best results:**
    - Use 300 DPI or higher scans
    - Ensure good contrast (black text on white)
    - Avoid skewed or rotated pages
    - Use clean, printed text (handwriting is hit-or-miss)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many sources can I add to an agent?" icon="folder">
    **No hard limit**, but for best performance:

    **Recommended:** 10-20 sources per agent

    **Why?** More sources = longer retrieval time. Quality over quantity.

    **Best practices:**
    - Only upload relevant documents
    - Remove duplicates
    - Split large documents into focused files
    - Archive outdated sources
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I update a source after uploading?" icon="rotate">
    **Yes!** Upload a new version with the same name to replace it.

    **What happens:**
    - Old version is archived (available in version history)
    - New version is indexed
    - All agents using this source automatically use the new version

    **Use case:** Update your price list monthly - all agents instantly use new prices.
  </Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My agent isn't doing what I expected" icon="face-confused">
    **Debugging steps:**

    1. **Check run logs**
       - Go to Runs tab
       - Click the failed/unexpected run
       - Read the AI reasoning to see what it thought

    2. **Review instructions**
       - Are they clear and specific?
       - Did you provide examples?
       - Are edge cases handled?

    3. **Check sources**
       - Are they attached to the agent?
       - Are they indexed (not still processing)?
       - Do they contain the expected information?

    4. **Test with simple data**
       - Try with 1-2 rows first
       - See where it goes wrong
       - Refine instructions

    5. **Ask for help**
       - Share run logs with our support team
       - We can review and suggest improvements
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is my agent slow?" icon="hourglass">
    **Common causes:**

    1. **Too many sources** → Reduce to only essential documents
    2. **Large sources** → Split into smaller, focused files
    3. **Processing many rows** → Consider batching
    4. **Complex instructions** → Simplify if possible
    5. **Heavy integrations** → API calls add time

    **Expected performance:**
    - Simple tasks: Seconds per row
    - Document extraction: 5-30 seconds per PDF
    - Complex workflows: 30-60 seconds per item

    If still slow, contact support - we can help optimize!
