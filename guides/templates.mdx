## Customizing Templates

After selecting a template:

### 1. Review Instructions

Read the pre-filled agent instructions. Modify to match your specific requirements.

### 2. Connect Integrations

Templates indicate which integrations are needed. Connect your accounts:

- Some templates work standalone (just spreadsheets)
- Others require specific integrations (Slack, email, etc.)

### 3. Upload Your Data

Replace sample data with your actual data:

- Upload your spreadsheet
- Map columns to expected fields
- Verify data looks correct

### 4. Test Thoroughly

Run test executions to verify:

- Data flows correctly
- Outputs match expectations
- Integration actions work

### 5. Go Live

Once testing passes, activate the agent to run automatically.
