## Overview

Worksheets are the spreadsheet interface in Decisional. They let you view, edit, and manage the data your agents work with. Think of them as smart spreadsheets that your AI agents can read from and write to.

## Worksheet Types

### Agent Worksheet

The primary worksheet for each agent:

- Contains the data your agent processes
- Agent can read from and write to this worksheet
- Locked during active runs to prevent conflicts

### User Worksheets

Additional worksheets you create:

- Upload your own data files
- Reference data that doesn't change often
- Agent has read-only access

## Working with Worksheets

### Tabbed Interface

Multiple worksheets open as tabs:

- Click tabs to switch between worksheets
- Drag tabs to reorder

### AI Editing Indicator

When your agent is modifying a worksheet, you'll see:

- A shimmer animation over affected cells
- "AI Editing" indicator in the tab
- Real-time updates as changes are made

## Worksheet Locking

During agent runs:

- The worksheet shows a **LOCKED** status
- You cannot edit locked worksheets
- Prevents conflicts between your edits and agent changes
- Automatically unlocks when the run completes

<Warning>
  Don't close the browser during a run. Wait for the worksheet to unlock before making manual changes.
</Warning>

Worksheets support basic validation:

- Required columns
- Data type enforcement
- Unique value constraints

Configure validation in worksheet settings.
