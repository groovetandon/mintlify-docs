## Overview

Schedule your agents to run automatically at specific times or intervals. Perfect for recurring tasks like daily reports, weekly data syncs, or hourly monitoring.

## Setting Up a Schedule

1. Open your agent
2. Navigate to the **Triggers** tab
3. Click **Add Trigger**
4. Select **Schedule**
5. Configure frequency and time
6. Save the trigger

## Schedule Options

### Hourly

Run every hour at a specific minute:

- "Every hour at :00" (on the hour)
- "Every hour at :30" (half past)
- Custom minute selection

### Daily

Run once per day:

- Select the time (e.g., 9:00 AM)
- Choose your timezone
- Runs every day at that time

### Weekly

Run on specific days:

- Select days of the week (Mon, Tue, Wed, etc.)
- Choose the time
- Can select multiple days

<Tip>
  Schedule agents during off-hours to avoid interfering with manual work on the same data.
</Tip>

## Timezone Handling

All schedules use your selected timezone:

- Set in your account settings
- Displayed next to schedule times
- Automatically handles daylight saving time

## Viewing Scheduled Runs

### Upcoming Runs

See when your next scheduled run will occur:

1. Open the agent
2. Check the **Triggers** tab
3. "Next run" shows the upcoming execution

### Run History

View past scheduled executions:

1. Navigate to the **Runs** tab
2. Filter by trigger type: "Scheduled"
3. Review execution history

## Managing Schedules

### Pausing a Schedule

Temporarily stop scheduled runs:

1. Open the trigger settings
2. Toggle **Active** off
3. Schedule pauses but configuration is preserved

### Editing a Schedule

Change frequency or timing:

1. Click on the schedule trigger
2. Modify settings
3. Save changes

Changes take effect for the next scheduled run.

### Deleting a Schedule

Remove the schedule entirely:

1. Click on the schedule trigger
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm deletion

## Best Practices

### Choose Appropriate Frequency

- **Hourly**: Real-time monitoring, frequent data syncs
- **Daily**: Reports, digest emails, data cleanup
- **Weekly**: Summaries, audits, batch processing

### Stagger Multiple Agents

If you have multiple scheduled agents:

- Don't schedule all at the same time
- Stagger by 5-10 minutes
- Reduces system load and potential conflicts

### Monitor Early Runs

When first setting up a schedule:

- Watch the first few executions
- Verify outputs are correct
- Adjust timing if needed

<Warning>
  Scheduled runs count toward your usage limits. Monitor your usage if running agents frequently.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Scheduled Run Didn't Execute

- Check if the agent is paused
- Verify the schedule is active
- Review the runs tab for any errors

### Wrong Time Execution

- Verify your timezone setting
- Check for daylight saving time transitions
- Ensure the schedule shows the expected next run
