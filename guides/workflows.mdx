## Overview

The Workflow Viewer shows a visual representation of how your agent processes data. Each workflow is a directed graph of nodes that execute in sequence or parallel.

## Understanding the Workflow

### Nodes

Each box in the workflow represents a step:

- **Input Node** - Where data enters the workflow
- **Processing Nodes** - Transform or analyze data
- **Integration Nodes** - Interact with external services
- **Output Node** - Final result of the workflow

### Connections

Lines between nodes show data flow:

- Data flows from top to bottom (or left to right)
- Parallel branches execute simultaneously
- All branches must complete before convergence

### Node Status

During and after runs, nodes show their status:

| Status | Indicator |
|--------|-----------|
| Pending | Gray outline |
| Running | Blue pulse animation |
| Success | Green checkmark |
| Failed | Red X |
| Skipped | Gray with dash |

## Viewing Workflows

### In the Agent Editor

1. Open your agent
2. Click **View Workflow** in the assistant panel
3. The workflow appears in a modal or side panel

### In Run Details

1. Open a completed run
2. Navigate to the **Workflow** tab
3. See the workflow with execution status for each node

## Workflow Features

### Zoom and Pan

- Scroll to zoom in/out
- Click and drag to pan
- Use the zoom controls in the corner

### Node Details

Click on any node to see:

- Node type and description
- Input/output schemas
- For completed runs: actual data processed

### Integration Icons

Nodes that use integrations display the integration logo:

- Slack nodes show the Slack icon
- Google Sheets nodes show the Sheets icon
- Makes it easy to identify what each step does

<Tip>
  Integration logos appear in color to make the workflow easier to scan at a glance.

## Scheduled Triggers in Workflows

If your agent has scheduled triggers, they appear at the top of the workflow:

- Shows the schedule (e.g., "Daily at 9am")
- Indicates when the next run will occur
- Click to edit trigger settings

## Hierarchical Layout

Workflows use intelligent positioning:

- Related nodes are grouped together
- Clear visual hierarchy from input to output
- Parallel branches are evenly spaced
- Minimal crossing lines for readability

## Exporting Workflows

For documentation or sharing:

1. Open the workflow viewer
2. Click the **...** menu
3. Select **Export as Image**
4. Choose PNG or SVG format
