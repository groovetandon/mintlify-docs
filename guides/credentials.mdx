## Overview

Credentials connect your Decisional agents to external services like Slack, HubSpot, Google Sheets, and more. Each credential stores the authentication needed to access an integration on your behalf.

## Connecting an Integration

1. Open your agent and navigate to the **Integrations** panel
2. Find the integration you want to connect
3. Click **Connect**
4. Follow the OAuth flow or enter API credentials
5. Name your credential for easy identification

## Credential Types

### OAuth Credentials

Most integrations use OAuth, which:

- Redirects you to the service to authorize
- Doesn't require you to share passwords
- Can be revoked from either Decisional or the service
- Automatically refreshes when tokens expire

### API Key Credentials

Some integrations require API keys:

- Generated in the service's developer settings
- Entered directly in Decisional
- You're responsible for rotation and security

## Credential Scope

### Private Credentials

Default for all new credentials:

- Only visible to you
- Only usable in your agents
- Other workspace members cannot see or use them

### Shared Credentials

Enable "Share with workspace" to:

- Make the credential visible to all workspace members
- Allow any workspace member to use it in their agents
- Useful for team-wide integrations (company Slack, shared CRM)

<Warning>
  Shared credentials give all workspace members access to that integration. Only share credentials that the entire team should use.
</Warning>

## Managing Credentials

### Viewing Credentials

Go to **Workspace Settings** > **Integrations** to see all credentials:

- Connection status (active, expired, error)
- Last used date
- Which agents use each credential

### Reconnecting

If a credential expires or has issues:

1. Click on the credential
2. Click **Reconnect**
3. Re-authorize with the service

### Deleting Credentials

1. Ensure no active agents use the credential
2. Go to credential settings
3. Click **Delete**

## Credential Locking

When your agent goes **Live**, credentials used by that agent are automatically locked:

- Prevents accidental disconnection
- Ensures production agents keep working
- Unlock by pausing the agent first

<Tip>
  Before going live, verify all required credentials are connected and working with a test run.
</Tip>

## Security Best Practices

1. **Use OAuth when available** - More secure than API keys
2. **Don't over-share** - Only share credentials when necessary
3. **Review regularly** - Remove unused credentials
4. **Use descriptive names** - Know which account each credential connects to
