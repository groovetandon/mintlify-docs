## Overview

Every time your agent executes, it creates a run. Runs are immutable records that show exactly what happened during execution, including inputs, outputs, and any errors.

## Viewing Runs

Navigate to your agent and click the **Runs** tab to see all executions. Each run shows:

- **Status** - Success, Failed, Running, or Cancelled
- **Type** - Test or Live
- **Started** - When the run began
- **Duration** - How long it took
- **Trigger** - What initiated the run (manual, scheduled, or integration)

## Filtering Runs

Use the filter controls to find specific runs:

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| Status | All, Success, Failed, Running |
| Type | All, Test, Live |
| Date Range | Last 24h, 7 days, 30 days, Custom |

<Tip>
  Use the Test/Live filter to quickly separate your test runs from production executions.
</Tip>

## Run Details

Click on any run to see detailed information:

### Overview Tab

- Run metadata (ID, duration, trigger)
- Final status and any error messages
- Input data that was provided

### Workflow Tab

Visual representation of the executed workflow showing:

- Each node and its status
- Execution order
- Time spent on each step

### Data Tab

- Input and output data for each node
- Before/after spreadsheet snapshots
- Any files that were generated

## Live Runs

Runs that are currently executing show a **Live** badge. You can:

- Watch progress in real-time
- See which node is currently executing
- Cancel the run if needed

## Debugging Failed Runs

When a run fails:

1. Click on the failed run
2. Check the error message in the Overview tab
3. Navigate to the Workflow tab to see which node failed
4. Use the Data tab to inspect inputs that caused the failure
5. Enable **Developer Mode** to see the underlying code

<Warning>
  Failed runs still count toward your usage. Check the error carefully before re-running.
</Warning>

## Downloading Run Data

For advanced debugging, you can download:

- **Debug JSON** - Complete run data including all node inputs/outputs
- **Workflow Code** - Python code that was executed
- **Output Files** - Any files generated during the run
