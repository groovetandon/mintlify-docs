## What Are Runs?

A **run** is a single execution of your agent's workflow. Every time your agent performs its task—whether triggered manually, by schedule, or by event—that's a run.

### Log Structure

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Execution Timeline">
    **Chronological view of all actions:**

    ```
    [09:00:01] Run started (Manual trigger by john@acme.com)
    [09:00:02] Reading instructions...
    [09:00:03] Loading worksheet "Quote Requests"
    [09:00:05] Found 10 rows with Status = "Pending"
    [09:00:07] Processing row 1: Acme Corp
    [09:00:09]   - Searching Price List for Product A
    [09:00:10]   - Found price: $50.00
    [09:00:11]   - Calculating total: 10 × $50 = $500
    [09:00:12]   - Applying 10% discount: $500 - $50 = $450
    [09:00:13]   - Writing to row 1 of Quotes sheet
    [09:00:14] Processing row 2: TechCo
    ...
    [09:02:30] All items processed successfully

    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="AI Reasoning">
    **Step-by-step thought process:**

    ```
    Reasoning for row 1 (Acme Corp):

    1. Customer request:
       - Product: Widget A
       - Quantity: 10
       - Special request: 10% volume discount

    2. Looking up pricing:
       - Searched "Price List" source
       - Found Widget A: $50.00 per unit
       - Citation: Price List.xlsx, Sheet1, Row 15

    3. Calculating:
       - Subtotal: 10 × $50.00 = $500.00
       - Discount: 10% of $500.00 = $50.00
       - Total: $500.00 - $50.00 = $450.00

    4. Validation:
       - Total > $0 ✓
       - Customer exists in database ✓
       - Product available ✓

    5. Output:
       - Quote ID: Q-2025-001
       - Total: $450.00

## Debugging Failed Runs

When a run fails, follow these steps to identify and fix the issue.

### Debugging Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Read the Error Message">
    The error message tells you what went wrong:

    **Common errors:**
    - "Source not found" → Source was deleted or renamed
    - "Column 'XYZ' not found" → Column name changed or misspelled
    - "API rate limit exceeded" → Too many requests to external service
    - "Formula error in cell B5" → Worksheet formula is broken
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Where It Failed">
    Look at the execution timeline to see the last successful step before failure.

    **Example:**
    ```
    [09:00:10] Processing row 5: StartupXYZ ✓
    [09:00:12] Processing row 6: GlobalCorp ✓
    [09:00:14] Processing row 7: FailCo ❌
                Error: Product "Widget Z" not found in Price List
    ```

    Row 7 is the problem.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reproduce in AI Assistant">
    Use the AI Assistant to test the failing scenario:

    ```
    Process row 7 only and show me what happens
    ```

    This lets you debug interactively.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify Root Cause">
    Common causes:

    **Data issues:**
    - Missing required fields
    - Invalid formats (wrong date format, non-numeric text)
    - Unexpected values

    **Configuration issues:**
    - Source deleted or renamed
    - Integration disconnected
    - Column names changed

    **Logic issues:**
    - Instructions don't handle edge case
    - Missing validation rules
    - Incorrect formula in worksheet
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fix the Issue">
    Based on root cause:

    **Data issues:** Clean the data, add validation
    **Configuration issues:** Reconnect integration, re-upload source
    **Logic issues:** Update instructions, add error handling
  </Step>

  <Step title="Retry the Run">
    Click **Retry** on the failed run to re-execute with the fix
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Failures & Solutions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Source not found" icon="folder-xmark">
    **Error:** `Source "Price List 2024.xlsx" not found`

    **Cause:** Source was deleted, renamed, or never uploaded

    **Solution:**
    1. Go to Sources tab
    2. Check if source exists
    3. If renamed, update instructions with new name
    4. If deleted, re-upload the source
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Column not found" icon="table">
    **Error:** `Column "Customer Name" not found in worksheet`

    **Cause:** Column was renamed, deleted, or misspelled in instructions

    **Solution:**
    1. Open the worksheet
    2. Verify column name (check spelling and case)
    3. Update instructions to match exact column name
    4. Or rename column to match instructions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Integration error" icon="plug">
    **Error:** `Gmail integration failed: Authentication expired`

    **Cause:** Integration was disconnected or credentials expired

    **Solution:**
    1. Go to Settings → Integrations
    2. Find the failing integration
    3. Click **Reconnect**
    4. Authorize again
    5. Retry the run
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Formula error" icon="function">
    **Error:** `Formula error in cell E5: #DIV/0!`

    **Cause:** Worksheet formula dividing by zero or referencing invalid cells

    **Solution:**
    1. Open worksheet and navigate to cell E5
    2. Check the formula
    3. Fix the formula (e.g., add IF check for zero)
    4. Save worksheet
    5. Retry run
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Timeout error" icon="clock">
    **Error:** `Run timed out after 10 minutes`

    **Cause:** Processing too much data or very slow external API

    **Solution:**
    1. **Process in smaller batches** (e.g., 100 rows at a time)
    2. **Optimize sources** (remove unnecessary documents)
    3. **Simplify instructions** (fewer complex steps)
    4. **Check external APIs** (slow response times)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
