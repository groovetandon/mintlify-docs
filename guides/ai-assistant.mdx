## What is the AI Assistant?

The **AI Assistant** is an interactive chat interface that lets you test your agent in real-time, debug issues, and iterate on your workflow before automating it.

<Card title="Key Difference" icon="lightbulb">
  **Agent** = Automated execution (runs on schedule or trigger)

  **AI Assistant** = Interactive testing (you chat with the agent)
</Card>

---

## Where to Find It

The AI Assistant panel appears on the **right side** of your agent page.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Your Agent">
    Click any agent from your home page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Look Right">
    The AI Assistant chat panel is on the right side of the screen
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Chatting">
    Type a message and hit Enter to interact with your agent
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  You can collapse/expand the AI Assistant panel with the toggle button in the top-right.
</Tip>

---

## How It Works

The AI Assistant uses the **same AI engine** as your automated agent, with access to:
- Your agent's instructions
- All uploaded sources
- Your worksheet data
- Connected integrations

**The difference:** Instead of running automatically, you control it through conversation.

---

## Testing Your Agent

Use the AI Assistant to test your agent before going live.

### Basic Testing Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Test Data">
    Add a few sample rows to your worksheet (e.g., 3-5 test cases)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Give a Command">
    In the AI Assistant, type:
    ```
    Process the first 3 rows in the worksheet
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Watch It Work">
    The AI Assistant will:
    - Read the instructions
    - Search relevant sources
    - Process the data
    - Show its reasoning step-by-step
    - Update the worksheet
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Results">
    Switch to the Worksheet tab to see the output
  </Step>

  <Step title="Iterate">
    If results aren't perfect, refine instructions and test again
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Test Commands

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Quote Generation">
    **Simple test:**
    ```
    Generate a quote for Acme Corp.
    They need 10x Product A and 5x Product B.
    Apply a 10% discount.
    ```

    **Batch test:**
    ```
    Process all rows in the "Quote Requests" sheet
    where Status = "Pending"
    ```

    **Edge case test:**
    ```
    What happens if a customer requests a product
    that's not in the price list?
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Invoice Processing">
    **Test with example:**
    ```
    I'm going to upload an invoice PDF.
    Extract the key details and add to the worksheet.
    ```

    **Test validation:**
    ```
    Process the invoice in row 5.
    Make sure the total matches the sum of line items.
    ```

    **Test error handling:**
    ```
    What would you do if the vendor is not found
    in the vendor list?
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Data Enrichment">
    **Test enrichment:**
    ```
    Take the company in row 1 and enrich it with:
    - Industry
    - Employee count
    - Revenue estimate
    - Key contacts
    ```

    **Test source usage:**
    ```
    Which sources would you use to enrich this lead?
    ```

    **Test output format:**
    ```
    Show me what the enriched row will look like
    before writing to the worksheet.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Debugging with AI Assistant

When your agent doesn't behave as expected, the AI Assistant helps you debug.

### Common Debugging Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent isn't using sources" icon="folder">
    **Ask:**
    ```
    What sources do you have access to?
    Can you show me what's in the "Price List" source?
    ```

    **The assistant will:**
    - List all available sources
    - Confirm they're indexed
    - Show sample content from the source

    **If source is missing:**

    What are you supposed to do?
    ```

    **The assistant will:**
    - Summarize its understanding
    - Show what it thinks it should do
    - Reveal any misinterpretations

    **Refine instructions:**
    - Clarify ambiguous parts
    - Add specific examples
    - Break complex steps into simpler ones
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data isn't being found" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Ask:**
    ```
    Can you see the data in the "Customers" sheet?
    Show me the first 3 rows.
    ```

    **The assistant will:**

## Interactive Iteration

The AI Assistant excels at iterative refinement.

### Iteration Pattern

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Attempt">
    ```
    Generate a quote for this customer
    ```

    *Reviews output - not quite right*
  </Step>

  <Step title="Refine Request">
    ```
    Actually, can you format the quote like the example
    in the "Quote Template.pdf" source?
    ```

    *Better, but missing something*
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Details">
    ```
    Also include a breakdown showing:
    - Subtotal
    - Discount amount
    - Tax
    - Grand total
    ```

    *Perfect!*
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Instructions">
    Copy the working approach into your agent instructions
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Iteration Session

**You:**
```
Process the first customer request
```

**AI Assistant:**
```
I've generated a quote for Acme Corp:
- 10x Widget A at $50 = $500
- Total: $500

Added to row 10 of the Quotes sheet.
```

**You:**
```
Wait, you forgot to apply the 10% discount they requested
```

**AI Assistant:**
```
You're right! Let me recalculate:
- Subtotal: $500
- 10% discount: -$50
- Total: $450

Should I update row 10 with the corrected total?
```

**You:**
```
Yes, and also show the discount as a separate line item
```

**AI Assistant:**
```
Updated row 10:
- Subtotal: $500
- Discount: -$50 (10%)
- Total: $450

I'll remember to always show discounts separately.
```

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Turn Conversations

The AI Assistant maintains context across messages:

```
You: "Find all customers with pending quotes"
AI: "Found 5 customers: Acme Corp, TechCo..."

You: "Generate quotes for the first 3"
AI: "Processing Acme Corp, TechCo, StartupXYZ..."

You: "Send the quotes via email"
AI: "Sending emails via Gmail integration..."
```

### Ask Questions

Get clarification on your workflow:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="About Instructions">
    ```
    What should I do if a product is out of stock?
    ```

    ```
    How do I handle customers who request custom pricing?
    ```

    ```
    What information do you need to generate a quote?
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="About Data">
    ```
    How many pending requests are in the worksheet?
    ```

    ```

## Best Practices

<Check>
  **Start small:** Test with 1-2 rows before processing hundreds
</Check>

<Check>
  **Use specific commands:** "Process row 5" is clearer than "do the thing"
</Check>

<Check>
  **Ask for explanations:** "Why did you choose that value?" helps debug
</Check>

<Check>
  **Iterate incrementally:** Make one change at a time, test, repeat
</Check>

<Check>
  **Save working approaches:** When something works well, copy it into your instructions
</Check>

<Check>
  **Use dry runs:** Preview results before actually writing to worksheets
</Check>

## Tips & Tricks

### Get Better Responses

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="bullseye">
    **Instead of:** "Do the thing"

    **Try:** "Generate a quote for the customer in row 5"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Ask Why" icon="question">
    **Instead of:** Accepting wrong output

    **Try:** "Why did you calculate the total as $500?"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Show Examples" icon="image">
    **Instead of:** Vague descriptions

    **Try:** "Format it like this: [example]"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Test Edge Cases" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Instead of:** Only happy paths

    **Try:** "What if the customer field is empty?"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Conversation Starters

Not sure what to ask? Try these:

**Understanding:**
- "Explain your job in your own words"
- "What are the main steps in your workflow?"
- "What data do you have access to?"

**Testing:**
- "Process the first row and show your work"
- "What would you do in this scenario: [describe edge case]"
- "Show me sample output before writing to the worksheet"

**Debugging:**
- "Why did the last run fail?"
- "What sources did you use for that decision?"
- "Can you walk me through your reasoning?"

**Optimization:**
- "How can I improve these instructions?"
- "What's the fastest way to process 1,000 rows?"
- "Are there any bottlenecks in the workflow?"

---

## Limitations

<Warning>
  The AI Assistant has the same limitations as your automated agent:
  - Can only access uploaded sources (can't browse the web unless you add links)
  - Respects your integration permissions
  - Limited by rate limits of external APIs
  - Can't execute code or install packages
</Warning>

### What AI Assistant CAN'T Do

❌ Run on a schedule (use automated runs for that)
❌ Process data while you're away (use triggers)
❌ Handle thousands of items efficiently (use batch runs)
❌ Make changes without your permission (you control each step)

### What AI Assistant CAN Do

✅ Test workflows before automation
✅ Debug failed runs interactively
✅ Explore and analyze data
✅ Answer questions about your workflow
✅ Generate one-off outputs
✅ Help refine instructions
