## Overview

Developer Mode gives you visibility into the Python code that powers your agent workflows. This is useful for debugging, understanding how your agent works, and advanced troubleshooting.

## Enabling Developer Mode

1. Open any agent run
2. Navigate to the **Workflow** tab
3. Toggle **Developer Mode** in the top-right corner

## What You Can See

### Workflow Code

The complete Python code that defines your workflow, including:

- Node definitions and their dependencies
- Data transformations between steps
- Integration API calls
- Error handling logic

### Node Details

Click on any node to see:

- **Input Schema** - What data the node expects
- **Output Schema** - What data the node produces
- **Code** - The Python function for that specific node

### Execution Data

For each node in a completed run:

- **Input Data** - Actual values passed to the node
- **Output Data** - Values returned by the node
- **Execution Time** - How long the node took
- **Logs** - Any console output or errors

## Code Panel Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Copy Code | Copy the workflow code to clipboard |
| Resize Panel | Drag to adjust the code panel width |
| Syntax Highlighting | Python code with full highlighting |
| Line Numbers | Easy reference for debugging |

<Tip>
  Use the copy feature to share code snippets when asking for help or reporting issues.

## Debugging with Developer Mode

1. **Find the failing node** - Look for nodes with error indicators
2. **Check the input data** - Verify the node received expected inputs
3. **Read the error message** - Usually indicates the specific issue
4. **Review the code** - Understand what the node is trying to do
5. **Download debug JSON** - Get complete data for offline analysis

## Debug JSON

The debug JSON file contains:

```json
{
  "run_id": "...",
  "workflow_version": "...",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "type": "...",
      "inputs": {...},
      "outputs": {...},
      "status": "...",
      "error": null
    }
  ]
}
```

<Warning>
  Debug JSON may contain sensitive data from your integrations. Handle it carefully and don't share publicly.
</Warning>
