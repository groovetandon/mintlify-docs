## Overview

When you describe what you want your agent to do, Decisional's AI analyzes your instructions and builds a workflow that executes your automation. This guide explains what happens during the build process.

## The Build Process

### 1. Instruction Analysis

The AI reads your natural language instructions and identifies:

- What data needs to be processed
- What integrations are required
- What transformations should happen
- What outputs should be produced

### 2. Workflow Generation

Based on the analysis, the AI generates:

- A directed graph of processing nodes
- Data transformations between nodes
- Integration API calls
- Error handling logic

### 3. Validation

Before completing the build:

- Checks all referenced integrations exist
- Validates data flows between nodes
- Ensures required credentials are connected
- Identifies potential issues

### 4. Testing

Optionally run a test execution to verify:

- Workflow executes without errors
- Outputs match expectations
- Integration calls work correctly

## Build Logs

Watch the build process in real-time:

1. Open your agent
2. Click **Build** in the assistant panel
3. Live logs stream as the build progresses

Log entries include:

- Instruction parsing progress
- Node generation status
- Validation checks
- Any warnings or errors

<Tip>
  Build logs help you understand what the AI is doing and identify any issues early.

## Rebuild vs Incremental Updates

### Full Rebuild

Triggered when you:

- Significantly change instructions
- Add or remove integrations
- Click "Rebuild" manually

Creates a new workflow from scratch.

### Incremental Updates

Triggered when you:

- Make minor instruction tweaks
- Adjust parameters
- Fix small issues

Only updates affected nodes.

## Build Errors

### Missing Integration

```
Error: Integration "slack" referenced but not connected
```

**Fix**: Connect the required integration in the Integrations panel.

### Invalid Tool Reference

```
Error: Tool "send_email" not found in connected integrations
```

**Fix**: Verify the integration is connected and supports the action you're trying to use.

### Circular Dependency

```
Error: Circular dependency detected between nodes
```

**Fix**: Simplify your instructions to avoid loops, or explicitly describe the order of operations.

## Build Best Practices

### Be Specific

Vague instructions lead to unexpected workflows:

- **Vague**: "Process the data"
- **Specific**: "For each row in the spreadsheet, extract the email and company name"

### Start Simple

Build incrementally:

1. Start with core functionality
2. Test that it works
3. Add additional features
4. Test again

### Check Validations

Pay attention to validation warnings:

- Yellow warnings are suggestions
- Red errors must be fixed
- Address warnings to avoid runtime issues

<Warning>
  Always test after building. A successful build doesn't guarantee correct behavior.
</Warning>

## Versioning

Each build creates a snapshot:

- Version number increments (v1, v2, v3...)
- Previous versions preserved in run history
- Can view which version each run used
