## Overview

Agents are the core of Decisional. Each agent automates a specific workflow, from data entry to document processing to outbound communications.

## Creating an Agent

1. Click **New Agent** from your workspace
2. Describe what you want the agent to do in plain English
3. The AI assistant will help refine your instructions
4. Connect any required integrations
5. Build and test your agent

## Agent Views

### List View

The default view showing all agents in a table format with:

- Agent name and description
- Status (Draft, Ready, Live, Paused)
- Last run date
- Quick actions

### Kanban View

Visual board organized by status:

- **Draft** - Agents still being configured
- **Ready** - Tested and ready to go live
- **Live** - Currently active and running
- **Paused** - Temporarily disabled

Drag and drop agents between columns to change their status.

<Tip>
  Use Kanban view to get a quick overview of your automation pipeline and identify bottlenecks.

## Agent Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Draft | Agent is being configured, not ready to run |
| Ready | Agent has been tested and is ready to go live |
| Live | Agent is active and will respond to triggers |
| Paused | Agent is temporarily disabled, no runs will execute |

## Agent Lifecycle

```
Draft → Ready → Live ↔ Paused
```

1. **Draft**: Configure instructions, connect integrations
2. **Ready**: Test thoroughly, verify outputs
3. **Live**: Agent runs automatically based on triggers
4. **Paused**: Temporarily stop without losing configuration

## Editing Agents

Click on any agent to open the editor:

- **Instructions** - What the agent should do
- **Integrations** - Connected services
- **Triggers** - What starts the agent
- **Runs** - Execution history

## Agent Templates

Start faster with pre-built templates:

1. Click **New Agent**
2. Select **Use Template**
3. Browse categories (Data Entry, Outbound, Processing)
4. Click **Use This Template**
5. Customize for your needs

## Duplicating Agents

To create a copy of an existing agent:

1. Open the agent
2. Click the **...** menu
3. Select **Duplicate**
4. Give the copy a new name

<Warning>
  Duplicated agents don't copy credentials. You'll need to reconnect integrations.
</Warning>

## Deleting Agents

1. Open the agent
2. Click the **...** menu
3. Select **Delete**
4. Confirm deletion

Deleted agents cannot be recovered. Consider pausing instead if you might need the agent later.
