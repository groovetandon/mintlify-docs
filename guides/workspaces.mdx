## What Are Workspaces?

A **workspace** is your team's shared environment in Decisional. It contains all your agents, worksheets, sources, integrations, and team members.

<Card title="Think of it like..." icon="lightbulb">
  A workspace is like a **Slack workspace** or **Google Workspace** - a shared space where your team collaborates on automation.
</Card>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't invite team member" icon="user-xmark">
    **Possible causes:**
    1. **Not an Admin/Owner:** Only Admins and Owners can invite
    2. **Plan limit:** Free plan limited to 3 members
    3. **Email already in use:** They're already in the workspace

    **Fix:**
    - Ask an Admin/Owner to invite
    - Upgrade plan for more members
    - Check team list for existing member
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Workspace not showing up" icon="eye-slash">
    **Possible causes:**
    1. **Wrong email:** Sign in with the email that was invited
    2. **Invitation expired:** Ask for a new invitation
    3. **Not yet accepted:** Check email for invitation link

    **Fix:**
    - Sign out and sign in with correct email
    - Contact workspace Admin for new invite
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't change role" icon="lock">
    **Possible causes:**
    1. **Insufficient permissions:** Only Admins/Owners can change roles
    2. **Trying to change Owner:** Owner role can only be transferred, not changed
    3. **Changing your own role:** Can't promote yourself

    **Fix:**
    - Ask an Admin/Owner to change the role
    - Use "Transfer Ownership" for Owner role
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
