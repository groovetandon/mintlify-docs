## Overview

Workspaces help you organize agents and collaborate with your team. Each workspace has its own set of agents, integrations, and credentials.

## Workspace Types

### Private Workspace

Your personal workspace where agents are only visible to you. This is the default when you sign up.

### Shared Workspace

A collaborative space where multiple team members can view and work on agents together.

## Creating a Workspace

1. Click on your workspace name in the top navigation
2. Select **Create Workspace**
3. Enter a name and description
4. Choose visibility settings
5. Click **Create**

## Inviting Team Members

1. Go to **Workspace Settings**
2. Navigate to the **Members** tab
3. Click **Invite Member**
4. Enter their email address
5. Select their role (Viewer, Editor, Admin)

## Requesting Access

If you need access to a workspace you're not a member of:

1. Navigate to the workspace URL
2. Click **Request Access**
3. The workspace owner will be notified
4. Once approved, you'll receive an email confirmation

<Tip>
  Workspace owners can see pending access requests with the requester's name for easier identification.

## Workspace Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| Viewer | View agents and runs, cannot edit |
| Editor | Create and edit agents, run agents |
| Admin | Full access including workspace settings and member management |
| Owner | All admin permissions plus ability to delete workspace |

## Credentials in Workspaces

Credentials are workspace-scoped, meaning:

- Each workspace has its own set of connected integrations
- Credentials can be private (only you) or shared with the workspace
- Use the "Share with workspace" toggle when connecting integrations

<Warning>
  Shared credentials are visible to all workspace members. Only share credentials that the entire team should have access to.
</Warning>
