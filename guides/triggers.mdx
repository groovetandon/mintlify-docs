## Overview

Triggers let your agents run automatically based on events or schedules. Instead of manually clicking "Run," you can set up triggers that execute your agents when specific conditions are met.

## Types of Triggers

### Scheduled Triggers

Run your agents on a recurring schedule:

- **Hourly** - Run every hour at a specific minute
- **Daily** - Run once per day at a specific time
- **Weekly** - Run on specific days of the week

### Integration Triggers

Run your agents when events happen in connected apps:

- **Slack** - New message in channel, DM received, reaction added
- **HubSpot** - New contact created, deal stage changed
- **Google Sheets** - Row added or modified
- **Email** - New email received matching criteria

## Setting Up a Trigger

1. Open your agent and navigate to the **Triggers** tab
2. Click **Add Trigger**
3. Select the trigger type (scheduled or integration)
4. Configure the trigger settings
5. Save and activate

<Tip>
  Test your trigger configuration with a test run before going live to ensure everything works as expected.
</Tip>

## Trigger Settings

Each trigger type has specific configuration options:

### Scheduled Trigger Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Frequency | How often to run (hourly, daily, weekly) |
| Time | When to run (timezone-aware) |
| Days | For weekly triggers, which days to run |

### Integration Trigger Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Integration | Which connected app to monitor |
| Event | Which event type to listen for |

## Managing Triggers

- **Pause/Resume** - Temporarily disable a trigger without deleting it
- **Edit** - Modify trigger settings at any time
- **Delete** - Remove a trigger permanently
- **View History** - See past trigger activations and their results

<Warning>
  When your agent goes live, credentials used by triggers are locked to prevent accidental disconnections.
