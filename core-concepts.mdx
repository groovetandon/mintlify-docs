## Overview

Decisional is built around a few core concepts. Understanding these will help you get the most out of the platform.

## Agents

Agents are the core of Decisional. Each agent is an AI worker that owns a specific workflow and runs it for you.

You create an agent by describing what you want it to do. It builds its own workflow, connects to the right tools, and tests itself. Once live, it runs on autopilot and you manage it by talking to it in chat.

### What Makes Up an Agent

- **Instructions** — what you told the agent to do, written in plain English
- **Workflow** — the step-by-step plan the agent built to carry out your instructions
- **Integrations** — the apps your agent connects to (Slack, HubSpot, Gmail, etc.)
- **Sources** — documents and files that give your agent context
- **Triggers** — how your agent gets activated (schedule, event, or manual)

### Agent States

Your agent moves through these states as you set it up:

- **Draft** — still being configured or built
- **Ready** — tested and ready to go live
- **Live** — running on autopilot
- **Paused** — temporarily stopped, can be resumed anytime

---

## Workflows

When you describe what you want, your agent creates a workflow — a series of steps it follows to get the job done.

Each step in the workflow is a **node**. Nodes can do things like:

- Read data from a spreadsheet
- Call an API or integration
- Process a document
- Run AI reasoning
- Write results back

You don't need to build the workflow yourself. Your agent figures out the steps, the order, and the logic. If you want to change something, just tell your agent in the chat and it updates the workflow.

### Workflow Viewer

You can see your agent's workflow visually at any time. It shows every node, how they connect, and the status of each step during a run.

---

## Integrations

Integrations are the apps your agents connect to and work with. When your agent needs to send a Slack message, update a HubSpot deal, or read from Google Sheets, it uses an integration.

### How Integrations Work

1. Your agent identifies which apps it needs based on your instructions
2. You authorize access to each app
3. Your agent uses them automatically in its workflow

Integrations can be shared across your workspace or kept private to specific agents.

<Tip>
  You can browse and connect integrations anytime from the **Integrations** page in the sidebar.

## Runs

Every time your agent executes its workflow, that's a run. You can see all your agent's runs from the **Runs** tab.

### Run Statuses

- **Running** — your agent is executing right now
- **Completed** — finished successfully
- **Failed** — something went wrong
- **Needs Approval** — your agent is waiting for you to approve an action

### What's in a Run

Each run shows you:

- A step-by-step breakdown of what happened at each node
- The input and output data for each step
- Files your agent produced
- How long it took

If a run fails, you can see exactly which step broke and why.

## Sources

Sources are documents and files you upload to give your agents context. Think of them as reference material your agent can look up when it needs to.

### What You Can Upload

- **PDFs** — contracts, invoices, forms, statements
- **Spreadsheets** — price lists, templates, historical data
- **Word docs** — policies, procedures, playbooks
- **Images** — forms and receipts (your agent can read these with OCR)

### How Agents Use Sources

Decisional uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to help your agent understand documents. When your agent needs information from a source, it retrieves only the relevant sections instead of trying to process the entire file. This works even across hundreds of pages.

---

## Workspaces

Workspaces are where your team organizes agents, integrations, and credentials.

### What's in a Workspace

- Your agents
- Connected integrations and credentials
- Team members and their permissions
- Sources and documents

### Team Access

Invite members from your organization into your workspace. Workspace owners control who can view, edit, and manage agents.

If you sign up with a company email, you'll automatically join your organization's workspace. Personal email addresses get their own workspace.
