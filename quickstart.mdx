## What You'll Build

In this quickstart, you'll create a simple **Quote Generation Agent** that:
- Takes a spreadsheet of products and pricing
- Generates customized quotes based on customer requirements
- Outputs results back to your spreadsheet

<Note>
  **Prerequisites:** You'll need a Decisional account. [Sign up here](https://app.decisional.com/sign-up) if you haven't already.
</Note>

## Step 1: Sign In

Go to [app.decisional.com](https://app.decisional.com) and sign in with your account.

## Step 2: Create Your First Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Home">
    From the sidebar, click **Home**. You'll see the automation prompt input.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Describe Your Workflow">
    In the prompt box, type:
    ```
    I want to generate quotes for customers based on a price list.
    The agent should take customer requirements and create a customized quote.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload Your Spreadsheet">
    Click **Upload Spreadsheet** and select a CSV or Excel file with your price list.

    Don't have one? Download our [sample price list](/examples/price-list.csv).

    Your spreadsheet should have columns like:
    - Product Name
    - Unit Price
    - Description
    - Category
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit">
    Click **Create Agent** and wait a few seconds while Decisional sets up your agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Configure Your Agent

You'll be taken to the **Agent page** with three sections:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Instructions">
    ### Writing Agent Instructions

    In the Instructions tab, you'll see a rich text editor where you can refine what your agent should do.

    **Example instructions:**
    ```
    You are a Quote Generation Agent. Your job is to:

    1. Review the price list spreadsheet
    2. When given customer requirements, select appropriate products
    3. Calculate total pricing including any discounts
    4. Generate a professional quote
    5. Save the quote to a new row in the spreadsheet

    Always include:
    - Quote ID (auto-generated)
    - Date
    - Customer name
    - List of products with quantities
    - Subtotal, taxes, and total
    ```

    <Tip>
      Write instructions in natural language. The AI understands context and intent.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Worksheet">
    ### Your Data Layer

    Click the **Worksheet** tab to see your uploaded spreadsheet. You can:
    - Edit data directly
    - Add new columns
    - Create formulas
    - Format cells

    This is where your agent will read data from and write results to.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Sources">
    ### Add Context (Optional)

    Click **Sources** in the left sidebar to upload additional context:
    - Quote templates (PDF)
    - Past quotes (for reference)
    - Company pricing policies

    Your agent will understand these documents and use them to make better decisions.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Test Your Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the AI Assistant">
    On the right side of the screen, you'll see the **AI Assistant** panel.

    This is where you interact with your agent in real-time.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Give Your Agent a Task">
    Type a message like:
    ```
    Generate a quote for Acme Corp. They need:
    - 10x Product A
    - 5x Product B
    - 3x Product C

    Apply a 10% volume discount.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Watch It Work">
    Your agent will:
    1. Read the price list from your worksheet
    2. Calculate pricing
    3. Apply the discount
    4. Generate the quote
    5. Add it to your worksheet

    You'll see the agent's reasoning in the chat as it works.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Results">
    Switch to the **Worksheet** tab to see the generated quote added to your spreadsheet!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Run It Automatically

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Schedule Recurring Runs">
    Want your agent to check for new quote requests daily?

    1. Click the **calendar icon** in the Instructions tab
    2. Set a schedule (e.g., "Every day at 9 AM")
    3. Your agent will run automatically
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Trigger on Events">
    You can also trigger your agent when:
    - A new row is added to your spreadsheet
    - An email is received
    - A form is submitted
    - A webhook is called

    Connect integrations in the **Integrations** page to enable event triggers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Run Manually">
    Click **Test Run** anytime to execute your agent manually.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 6: Monitor Runs

<Steps>
  <Step title="View Run History">
    Click the **Runs** tab to see all past executions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Status">
    Each run shows:
    - Status (Running, Completed, Failed, Needs Review)
    - Duration
