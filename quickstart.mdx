## Before You Start

You'll need a Decisional account. [Sign up here](https://agents.decisional.com/sign-up) if you haven't already.

## Step 1: Describe What You Want

Go to [agents.decisional.com](https://agents.decisional.com) and sign in. You'll see a prompt box on the home page.

Tell Decisional what you want your agent to do in plain English. For example:

```
Every morning, check my HubSpot for new deals that closed yesterday,
pull the contract PDF from each deal, extract the key terms,
and add a row to my spreadsheet with the deal name, value, and renewal date.
```

You can also upload files for context — spreadsheets, PDFs, price lists, templates — whatever your agent needs to understand the job.

<Tip>
  Be specific about what you want the outcome to look like. The more detail you give, the better your agent will be.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Your Agent Builds Itself

Once you submit, Decisional starts building your agent through a conversation. You'll see it:

1. Break your request into a workflow of steps
2. Identify which integrations it needs
3. Generate the logic for each step
4. Test everything automatically

You can follow along in the chat as it works. If something doesn't look right, just tell it to change it.

## Step 3: Connect Your Integrations

Your agent will ask you to connect any apps it needs — Slack, HubSpot, Gmail, Google Sheets, etc.

Click the integration link, authorize access, and you're connected. Your agent handles the rest.

<Tip>
  You can connect integrations at any time from the **Integrations** page in the sidebar.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Test Your Agent

Before going live, run a test to make sure everything works.

Your agent will walk through its workflow step by step. For action nodes (things that write data, send emails, etc.), it pauses and asks for your approval before executing.

Review the results, check the output, and if something needs tweaking — just tell your agent in the chat.

## Step 5: Go Live

When you're happy with the test, set your agent live. You can configure it to run:

- **On a schedule** — every morning, every hour, weekly, whatever you need
- **On triggers** — when a Slack message comes in, a form is submitted, or an event fires in a connected app
- **On demand** — run it manually anytime

## Step 6: Monitor and Manage

Once live, you can see all your agent's runs from the **Runs** tab. Each run shows:

- Status (Running, Completed, Failed, Needs Approval)
- What happened at each step
- The files and data your agent produced

Need to change something? Open the chat and tell your agent what to update. It modifies its own workflow based on your instructions.
